# Simple Linux Terminal AI Wrapper

The goal of this project is to integrate a simple AI wrapper to help the user better understand the outputs it receive fro the terminal invoked by the user. The output and input in the terminal is logged automatically after running `./shell_logging.sh` and is saved in a personal `log` directory inside the host (`/home/{hostname}`directory. 

To run the AI and ask question(s) pertain to the log content, it uses a custom shell command. In my case, it's `AIag`. For more details about arguments, please go to ....
